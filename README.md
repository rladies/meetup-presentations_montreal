**The Philosophy and Statistics of Causal Inference**

In this informal talk, [Dr. Mireille Schnitzer](https://www.mireilleschnitzer.com/) will give an overview of the foundations of what has become known as the field of “causal inference”. We will explore the historically popular idea of the sufficiency of data (i.e. that we can learn everything we need if we have enough data) and how this idea is violated when the goal is to infer on the effect of a cause. We will learn about the new-school perspectives on the connection between study design and assumptions that are needed -- in addition to data -- that allow us to properly estimate causal effects. Finally, we will go into more detail on the major contributions from various areas of research (statistics, computer science, epidemiology, and econometrics) that can be integrated to create a more-or-less cohesive approach to quantitative populational causal inference.
